# TextGen Library

TextGen is a Python library designed to help users add text to images with ease. It provides tools for image processing, text region detection, and text overlay, making it ideal for tasks like creating annotated images, generating memes, or adding captions to photos.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Convert images to grayscale, remove noise, and apply thresholding.
- **Text Region Detection**: Automatically detect regions in an image where text can be added.
- **Text Overlay**: Add custom text to specific regions of an image.
- **Customizable**: Define your own text region detection logic or manually specify text areas.
